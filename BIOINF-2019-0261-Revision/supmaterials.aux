Of the multi-locus implementations, Eagle had the lowest memory usage. Also, it was the only multi-locus implementation able to produce results for data under scenario 10000 x 1.5M. This is due to its ability to handle data larger than the available memory of a computer. FaST-LMM was run where all the SNP data are used to estimate the relationship matrix (FaST-LMM$^{all}$) and where genotype data from every five-hundredth SNP are used to estimate the relationship matrix (FaST-LMM$^{few}$)}}{5}}
