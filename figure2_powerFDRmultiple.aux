Plots for only those simulation scenarios where all multiple-locus methods could be implemented are shown. Eagle has the highest power across the four scenarios but MLMM also performs well. A false discovery rate of greater than 10\% is typically not employed in GWASs so the upper limit of the x-axis is 0.1.}}{1}}
