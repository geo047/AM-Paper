The maximum amount of memory on the computer is 128 Gigabytes. The x-axis is on the log scale. GEMMA, a single-locus implementation, had the lowest memory usage. Of the multiple-locus implementations, Eagle had the lowest memory usage. Also, it was the only multiple-locus implementation able to produce results for data under scenario 10000x1.5M. This is due to its ability to handle data larger than the available memory of a computer. FaST-LMM was run where all the snp data are used to estimate the relationship matrix (FaST-LMM$^{all}$) and where genotype data from every five-hundredth snp are used to estimate the relationship matrix (FaST-LMM$^{few}$)}}{2}}
