	Abstract = {{Conventional prediction of dairy cattle merit involves setting up and
   solving linear equations with the number of unknowns being the number of
   animals, typically millions, multiplied by the number of traits being
   simultaneously assessed. The coefficient matrix has been large and
   sparse and iteration on data has been the method of choice, whereby the
   coefficient matrix is not stored but recreated as needed. In contrast,
   genomic prediction involves assessment of the merit of genome fragments
   characterized by single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, currently
   some 50,000, which can then be used to predict the merit of individual
   animals according to the fragments they have inherited. The prediction
   equations for chromosome fragments typically have fewer than 100,000
   unknowns, but the number of observations used to predict the fragment
   effects can be one-tenth the number of fragments. The coefficient matrix
   tends to be dense and the resulting system of equations can be ill
   behaved. Equivalent computing algorithms for genomic prediction were
   derived. The number of unknowns in the equivalent system grows with
   number of genotyped animals, usually bulls, rather than the number of
   chromosome fragment effects. In circumstances with fewer genotyped
   animals than single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, these equivalent
   computations allow the solving of a smaller system of equations that
   behaves numerically better. There were 3 solving strategies compared: 1
   method that formed and stored the coefficient matrix in memory and 2
   methods that iterate on data. Finally, formulas for reliabilities of
   genomic predictions of merit were developed.}},
