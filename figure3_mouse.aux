Eagle was run under two settings; its default setting (Eagle$^{default}$) and where the model selection criterion had been optimised for a false discovery rate of 5\% (Eagle$^{optimal}$). The number of SNP-trait associations found are reported. The bar plots framed by boxes are for those traits where using Eagle (default and optimal) resulted in more findings than with single-locus analysis.}}{1}}
