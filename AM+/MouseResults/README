Whole mouse directory moved to bragg-i1 on ~/MWAM/RealDataAnalysis/Mouse due to 
computational issues with running data prep on laptop

 DIARY for read data analysis of publicaly available data on inbred mouse lines

05/01/17
 * data being downloaded from http://www.informatics.jax.org/   [MGI mouse genomic informatics database]
   Using browser - Mouse SNP summary page where I set
                   1. Genome region   Chromosome          1
                                      Genome Coordinates  0-200
                                                          Mbp
                      I then save the results to a tab sep text file on mac. 
                   2. I run R CMD BATCH ./cleandata.R  in ./RScripts on Mac to prepare the marker data for analysis

 ===> found that there was very little actual observed marker data
       Moved to inbred mouse data based on EMMA paper

 *  data being downloaded from Broad institute
http://archive.broadinstitute.org/mouse/hapmap/prev_index.html
    - Run R CMD BATCH ./makeGWASdata.R

Discovered new web site with imputed marker data for mouse RI strains. 


http://mouse.cs.ucla.edu/mousehapmap/full.html

Downloading data from “Imputed calls with high-confidence” into RawData directory on MAC and processing to see what GWAS results are like. 
* issue - the genotype file mousehapmap_perlegen_imputed_full_HC.txt contains lower
          and upper case alleles. Need to capitalise using sed.

          Command used is : use awk commande
