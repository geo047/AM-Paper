Eagle is compared against five other multiple-locus programs (top left plot) and two single-locus programs (top right plot). The x- and y-axes are on a log scale for improved aesthetics. Eagle has the lowest run-times of the multiple-locus programs, sometimes by orders of magnitude. Eagle can even produce results faster than single-locus programs. The actual median run times for the programs across the scenarios are given in the table. The entries in a bold font correspond to the lowest run-time for a scenario. FaST-LMM$^{all}$ is where the single-locus results are based on all the available SNP data. FaST-LMM$^{few}$ is where the single-locus results as based on a subset of the available SNP data. }}{1}}
